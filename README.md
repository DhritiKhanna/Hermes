# Hermes

Hermes is a verification tool for C/C++ MPI programs for the purpose of deadlock detection. 
It combines dynamic verification with symbolic analysis.
Primary goal is to symbolically verify the complete state space of the program with
as less number of program executions as possible. It is based on the dynamic verifier ISP.

## Benchmarks

All the benchmarks used for the paper for the three reported experiments are available.
